# 2022-EMSE-Race-and-Ethnicity-Diversity-and-Collaborative-Contributions-Frequency
We are sharing the dataset we used in the paper **"Relationship Between Diversity of Collaborative Group Membersâ€™ Race and Ethnicity and the Frequency of their Collaborative Contributions in GitHub"** in the interest of encouraging others to replicate and build upon our work. 

In this repository, you can find:
1. The scripts we used to infer the gender, race and ethnicity of the developers 
2. The scripts we used to answer RQ1, RQ2.1, and RQ2.2
3. The datasets we used in our analysis.
